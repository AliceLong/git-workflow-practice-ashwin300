# Website & Analysis
[neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/)

I chose this website because it was helpful for me when I was studying for interviews. It's a list of problems that help build fundamental knowledge of data structures & algorithms in a structured format. Even though it does not have anything to do with the actual job as a software engineer, it's neccesary in order to pass the interviews, and helps develop problem solving skills.
